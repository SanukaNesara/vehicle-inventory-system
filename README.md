cd vehicle-inventory-system
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start the application**

```bash
npm start
```

The app will automatically:

- Start the React development server
- Open the Electron desktop application
- Initialize the database (mock mode for development)

## üíª Development Commands

```bash
# Start development with hot reload
npm start

# Start React dev server only
npm run react-start

# Start Electron only (requires React server)
npm run electron-start

# Build React app for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test

# Package for current platform
npm run electron-pack

# Build and package
npm run dist
```

## üì¶ Building Executables

### For Current Platform

```bash
npm run build
npm run electron-pack
```

### For Specific Platforms

```bash
# Windows
npm run electron-pack:win

# macOS
npm run electron-pack:mac

# Linux
npm run electron-pack:linux

# All platforms
npm run dist:all
```

### Cross-Platform Building

#### Windows Build (from macOS/Linux)

1. **Using GitHub Actions** (Recommended)

   - Push to GitHub repository
   - Actions will automatically build for all platforms
   - Download artifacts from Actions tab

2. **Using Windows Machine**
   - Transfer project to Windows
   - Install Node.js and npm
   - Run: `npm install && npm run dist`

#### Build Output

- **Windows**: `dist/AutoParts Pro Setup 1.0.0.exe`
- **macOS**: `dist/AutoParts Pro-1.0.0-arm64.dmg`
- **Linux**: `dist/AutoParts Pro-1.0.0.AppImage`

## üóÑÔ∏è Database

### Local Database

- **Location**: OS-specific user data directory
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/vehicle-inventory-system/`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%/vehicle-inventory-system/`
  - Linux: `~/.config/vehicle-inventory-system/`

### Database Schema

- **Parts**: Inventory items with pricing, stock, and photos
- **Stock Movements**: Inventory transaction history
- **Job Cards**: Service jobs with customer details
- **Job Card Parts**: Parts used in jobs
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Automated stock monitoring

### Database Management

Use [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to directly manage the database file.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Storage

The application uses SQLite for reliable local data storage. No cloud setup is required - the database is automatically created when you first run the app.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Desktop**: Electron 22
- **Database**: SQLite3 with better-sqlite3
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **Icons**: React Icons
- **Build**: Electron Builder

## üì± Application Features

### Inventory Management

- Add parts with detailed information
- Photo upload and display
- Part type classification (new/used)
- Pricing and profit margin management
- Advanced search and filtering

### Job Cards

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### White Screen on Startup

- Ensure `npm run build` has been executed
- Check developer tools console for errors
- Verify all dependencies are installed

#### SQLite3 Errors

- **WSL2 Users**: Run on native Windows or use Docker
- **Native Dependencies**: Run `npm rebuild sqlite3 --runtime=electron`
- **Fallback**: App uses mock database if SQLite3 unavailable

#### Build Failures

```bash
# Clean rebuild
rm -rf node_modules dist build
npm install
npm run build
npm run electron-pack
```

### Performance

- Development uses mock database for fast startup
- Production builds include native SQLite3
- Images stored as base64 in database
