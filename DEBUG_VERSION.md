# Debug Version Instructions

## ðŸ”§ Manual Debug Build Created

I've created a debug version of AutoParts Pro that you can run to test the fixes:

### Location:
```
C:\Users\USER\Documents\vehicle-inventory-system\temp-build\
```

### How to Run:
1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell**
2. **Navigate to the folder:**
   ```cmd
   cd C:\Users\USER\Documents\vehicle-inventory-system\temp-build
   ```
3. **Run the debug version:**
   ```cmd
   npx electron .
   ```

### What This Debug Version Does:
âœ… **Forces Production Mode**: Loads local HTML instead of localhost:3000
âœ… **Shows Developer Tools**: Automatically opens console for debugging
âœ… **Detailed Logging**: Shows what's happening during startup
âœ… **Error Handling**: Dashboard shows loading states and error messages
âœ… **HashRouter**: Uses proper routing for Electron apps

### What You Should See:
1. **App opens with developer tools**
2. **Console shows loading messages**
3. **Dashboard shows either:**
   - "Loading Dashboard..." (briefly)
   - Error message if electronAPI isn't working
   - Actual dashboard content if everything works

### Console Output to Look For:
```
Preload script loaded
ElectronAPI exposed to renderer
Window loaded, electronAPI available: true
Loading URL: file:///.../index.html
File exists: true
```

### If Still Empty:
The developer tools console will show exactly what's wrong:
- Is electronAPI available?
- Are there JavaScript errors?
- Is the file loading correctly?

This debug version will help us identify the exact issue causing the empty content area.

## Alternative Quick Fix:
If you prefer, you can also:
1. Uninstall the current AutoParts Pro
2. Run this debug version to confirm it works
3. Then we can create a proper installer with the fixes
