# Fixes Applied to AutoParts Pro

## Issues Fixed:
1. **Empty Main Content Area**: Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter for better Electron compatibility
2. **ElectronAPI Loading**: Added fallback handling when electronAPI is not immediately available
3. **Dashboard Loading**: Added delay and error handling for database connections
4. **Debug Support**: Added developer tools and console logging for troubleshooting

## Files Modified:
- `src/App.js`: Changed to HashRouter
- `src/pages/Dashboard.js`: Added electronAPI availability checks and delay
- `electron/main.js`: Added debugging and developer tools

## Current Status:
The React build has been updated with these fixes. The existing installer in `dist/AutoParts Pro Setup 1.0.0.exe` contains the older version.

## Next Steps:
1. Uninstall the current AutoParts Pro from Windows
2. Use the updated portable version in `dist/win-unpacked/AutoParts Pro.exe` which has the React fixes
3. Or rebuild on a native Windows machine for a complete installer

## Alternative Solution:
If you have access to a native Windows machine (not WSL), you can:
1. Copy this entire project folder to Windows
2. Run `npm install` 
3. Run `npm run dist` 
4. This will create a properly working installer with all fixes

## Testing the Current Fix:
The portable version in `dist/win-unpacked/AutoParts Pro.exe` should now:
- Show the Dashboard content properly
- Handle routing correctly 
- Display developer tools for debugging
- Have proper error handling for database connections
